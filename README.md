# Business.NJ.gov

[Business.NJ.gov](https://business.nj.gov) is being developed by the Office of Innovation, Department of State's Business Action Center and the Economic Development Authority with support from Departments and Agencies across the State.

This site and the Governor's Business First Stop initiative are intended to simplify and streamline access to the information, resources, and services that aspiring entrepreneurs and business owners need to start, operate, and grow their business in the Garden State.

We are launching Business.NJ.gov in beta and using real-time user input to iteratively improve the site and services. The site is also being developed with the support and input of business communities throughout the State.

### Built as Open Source
